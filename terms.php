                    <p>SentientX will not be responsible for any damages your business may suffer and makes no warranties of any kind, expressed or implied for services we provide.</p>
                    <h3>payment terms</h3>
                    <p>The Customer will be invoiced progressively or a one-time upfront fee depending on the services. Accounts are considered to be terminated if payment is not received within 14 days from date of invoice.</p>
                    <p>Accounts whose amount or balance exceeds 30 days payment are liable to have their Service interrupted or terminated. Such interruption or termination does not relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all outstanding amounts. The Client agrees to pay SentientX all its reasonable expenses, including attorney and collection agency fees, in enforcing its rights under these terms and conditions.</p>
                    <p>All non-fully paid services and products remain the property of SentientX.</p>
                    <h3>cancellation of orders</h3>
                    <p>We will refund the amount paid if the order is cancelled due to the unavailability of goods or our inability to deliver the Services within the agreed time frame.</p>
                    <p>Any cancellation once the order is confirmed and submitted by the Client would require payment of half of the price of the Service according to the agreement.</p>
                    <h3>change of particulars</h3>
                    <p>It shall be the responsibility of the Client to inform SentientX of any changes in Client's personal particulars.</p>
                    <h3>delay in completing of service</h3>
                    <p>If there is a delay on delivering of services from SentientX's end, SentientX will inform the client in writing to explain the situation and work out a win-win arrangement. Refunds or compensation is subjected to specially pre-arranged agreement.</p>
                    <p>If there is a delay on providing information from the client's end to facilitate the delivering or completion of service, SentientX will give the client 3 months allowance. If the client fails to do so in 3 months, SentientX will cease all support and work on the provided services.</p>
